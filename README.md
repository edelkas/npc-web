N++ Palette Creator - Web Version

This will help you create your own customized color themes / palettes for N++.

# How to use the editor:

Load a palette on Import, change the colors of it's differnt elements from the bottom menu, draw the rest of the owl, click Export to download a zip containing all 35 files of the N++ palette.

# How to load the palette on N++:

You will have to put the palette folder (which name will be the in-game name of the palette) into the `Palettes` folder of your N++ installation directory, inside your Steam folder. It should be something like this:

Linux: `home/<user>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`

Windows: `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`

mac: `home/<user>/Library/ ... /steamapps/common/N++/NPP/Palettes`

Important note: It's likely you won't have a folder named Palettes, in which case you will have to create it.
